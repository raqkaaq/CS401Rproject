      "RESPONSE": "It's called \"Peculiar Properties\": \nOn my cutting board, I discovered them,\r\n\r\nthe tiniest of ants, roaming dots of lead.\r\n\r\nAt first, they were too few to classify, hiding\r\n\r\nunder crumbs, these scavengers of leftovers.\r\n\r\nAdmiring their labor, I immediately granted them\r\n\r\ncitizenship, these tailgaters of a kitchen's routines.\r\n\r\nIn Miami, I had no stove, working far from my home.\r\n\r\nMy wife was a midnight call to San Bernardino.\r\n\r\nWhile searching for crumbs, especially for\r\n\r\nthe taste of apricot jelly, they fell into a line\r\n\r\nacross my cutting board; I saw it again,\r\n\r\nsaw the line my sixth-grade teacher drew\r\n\r\non the board, pointing to each end.\r\n\r\nWhile he planted himself on his desk, he leaned\r\n\r\nhis face toward us, telling us in a low voice:\r\n\r\n\"You don't see it yet, you're too young\r\n\r\nstill, but that line in front of you continues\r\n\r\ninfinitely on either side. And if there is\r\n\r\nthe slightest slope in that line, either way,\r\n\r\nit will slowly begin to sag, then curve and veer\r\n\r\nand eventually one end will find the other.\r\n\r\nAnd lines, lines are never perfect, they are\r\n\r\nlike us, never completely straight. So just\r\n\r\nimagine the searching that goes on all\r\n\r\naround us, every day. And to happen on\r\n\r\nthat union is really to witness the most earthly\r\n\r\nof forms you'll ever get to know. If you're lucky,\r\n\r\nyou'll see that, even luckier if you're part\r\n\r\nof that union.\"",
