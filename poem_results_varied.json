      "RESPONSE": "It's called \"Peculiar Properties\": \nOn my cutting board, I discovered them,\r\n\r\nthe tiniest of ants, roaming dots of lead.\r\n\r\nAt first, they were too few to classify, hiding\r\n\r\nunder crumbs, these scavengers of leftovers.\r\n\r\nAdmiring their labor, I immediately granted them\r\n\r\ncitizenship, these tailgaters of a kitchen's routines.\r\n\r\nIn Miami, I had no stove, working far from my home.\r\n\r\nMy wife was a midnight call to San Bernardino.\r\n\r\nWhile searching for crumbs, especially for\r\n\r\nthe taste of apricot jelly, they fell into a line\r\n\r\nacross my cutting board; I saw it again,\r\n\r\nsaw the line my sixth-grade teacher drew\r\n\r\non the board, pointing to each end.\r\n\r\nWhile he planted himself on his desk, he leaned\r\n\r\nhis face toward us, telling us in a low voice:\r\n\r\n\"You don't see it yet, you're too young\r\n\r\nstill, but that line in front of you continues\r\n\r\ninfinitely on either side. And if there is\r\n\r\nthe slightest slope in that line, either way,\r\n\r\nit will slowly begin to sag, then curve and veer\r\n\r\nand eventually one end will find the other.\r\n\r\nAnd lines, lines are never perfect, they are\r\n\r\nlike us, never completely straight. So just\r\n\r\nimagine the searching that goes on all\r\n\r\naround us, every day. And to happen on\r\n\r\nthat union is really to witness the most earthly\r\n\r\nof forms you'll ever get to know. If you're lucky,\r\n\r\nyou'll see that, even luckier if you're part\r\n\r\nof that union.\"",

As I step out of my comfort zone, I feel a sense of freedom and wonder that I never knew existed before. \n\nMy favorite travel destinations are located in the United States, specifically in California, New York, and Hawaii. These areas offer a mix of natural beauty, cultural richness, and diverse landscapes that captivate me. Each location provides a unique perspective on American culture and history, making them unforgettable experiences. \n\nAs I reflect on my journey through the themes of living, the mind, activities, travels, and journeys, I am reminded of the power of imagination and the ability to create meaningful connections with others.

      "RESPONSE": "Of course! It's called \"The Sundays of Satin-Legs Smith\": \nInamoratas, with an approbation,\r\n\r\nBestowed his title. Blessed his inclination.\r\n\r\nHe wakes, unwinds, elaborately: a cat\r\n\r\nTawny, reluctant, royal. He is fat\r\n\r\nAnd fine this morning. Definite. Reimbursed.\r\n\r\nHe waits a moment, he designs his reign,\r\n\r\nThat no performance may be plain or vain.\r\n\r\nThen rises in a clear delirium.\r\n\r\nHe sheds, with his pajamas, shabby days.\r\n\r\nAnd his desertedness, his intricate fear, the\r\n\r\nPostponed resentments and the prim precautions.\r\n\r\nNow, at his bath, would you deny him lavender\r\n\r\nOr take away the power of his pine?\r\n\r\nWhat smelly substitute, heady as wine,\r\n\r\nWould you provide? life must be aromatic.\r\n\r\nThere must be scent, somehow there must be some.\r\n\r\nWould you have flowers in his life? suggest\r\n\r\nAsters? a Really Good geranium?\r\n\r\nA white carnation? would you prescribe a Show\r\n\r\nWith the cold lilies, formal chrysanthemum\r\n\r\nMagnificence, poinsettias, and emphatic\r\n\r\nRed of prize roses? might his happiest\r\n\r\nAlternative (you muse) be, after all,\r\n\r\nA bit of gentle garden in the best\r\n\r\nOf taste and straight tradition? Maybe so.\r\n\r\nBut you forget, or did you ever know,\r\n\r\nHis heritage of cabbage and pigtails,\r\n\r\nOld intimacy with alleys, garbage pails,\r\n\r\nDown in the deep (but always beautiful) South\r\n\r\nWhere roses blush their blithest (it is said)\r\n\r\nAnd sweet magnolias put Chanel to shame.\r\n\r\nNo! He has not a flower to his name.\r\n\r\nExcept a feather one, for his lapel.\r\n\r\nApart from that, if he should think of flowers\r\n\r\nIt is in terms of dandelions or death.\r\n\r\nAh, there is little hope. You might as well\u2014\r\n\r\nUnless you care to set the world a-boil\r\n\r\nAnd do a lot of equalizing things,\r\n\r\nRemove a little ermine, say, from kings,\r\n\r\nShake hands with paupers and appoint them men,\r\n\r\nFor instance\u2014certainly you might as well\r\n\r\nLeave him his lotion, lavender and oil.\r\n\r\nLet us proceed. Let us inspect, together\r\n\r\nWith his meticulous and serious love,\r\n\r\nThe innards of this closet. Which is a vault\r\n\r\nWhose glory is not diamonds, not pearls,\r\n\r\nNot silver plate with just enough dull shine.\r\n\r\nBut wonder-suits in yellow and in wine,\r\n\r\nSarcastic green and zebra-striped cobalt.\r\n\r\nWith shoulder padding that is wide\r\n\r\nAnd cocky and determined as his pride;\r\n\r\nBallooning pants that taper off to ends\r\n\r\nScheduled to choke precisely.\r\n\r\n                                           Here are hats\r\n\r\nLike bright umbrellas; and hysterical ties\r\n\r\nLike narrow banners for some gathering war.\r\n\r\nPeople are so in need, in need of help.\r\n\r\nPeople want so much that they do not know.\r\n\r\nBelow the tinkling trade of little coins\r\n\r\nThe gold impulse not possible to show\r\n\r\nOr spend. Promise piled over and betrayed.\r\n\r\nThese kneaded limbs receive the kiss of silk.\r\n\r\nThen they receive the brave and beautiful\r\n\r\nEmbrace of some of that equivocal wool.\r\n\r\nHe looks into his mirror, loves himself\u2014\r\n\r\nThe neat curve here; the angularity\r\n\r\nThat is appropriate at just its place;\r\n\r\nThe technique of a variegated grace.\r\n\r\nHere is all his sculpture and his art\r\n\r\nAnd all his architectural design.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you would prefer to this a fine\r\n\r\nValue of marble, complicated stone.\r\n\r\nWould have him think with horror of baroque,\r\n\r\nRococo. You forget and you forget.\r\n\r\nHe dances down the hotel steps that keep\r\n\r\nRemnants of last night\u2019s high life and distress.\r\n\r\nAs spat-out purchased kisses and spilled beer.\r\n\r\nHe swallows sunshine with a secret yelp.\r\n\r\nPasses to coffee and a roll or two.\r\n\r\nHas breakfasted.\r\n\r\n                        Out. Sounds about him smear,\r\n\r\nBecome a unit.

The Mickey Mouse,\r\n\r\nHowever, is for everyone in the house.\r\n\r\nSquires his lady to dinner at Joe\u2019s Eats.\r\n\r\nHis lady alters as to leg and eye,\r\n\r\nThickness and height, such minor points as these,\r\n\r\nFrom Sunday to Sunday. But no matter what\r\n\r\nHer name or body positively she\u2019s\r\n\r\nIn Queen Lace stockings with ambitious heels\r\n\r\nThat strain to kiss the calves, and vivid shoes\r\n\r\nFrontless and backless, Chinese fingernails,\r\n\r\nEarrings, three layers of lipstick, intense hat\r\n\r\nDripping with the most voluble of veils.\r\n\r\nHer affable extremes are like sweet bombs\r\n\r\nAbout him, whom no middle grace or good\r\n\r\nCould gratify. He had no education\r\n\r\nIn quiet arts of compromise. He would\r\n\r\nNot understand your counsels on control, nor\r\n\r\nThank you for your late trouble.\r\n\r\n                                                At Joe\u2019s Eats\r\n\r\nYou get your fish or chicken on meat platters.\r\n\r\nWith coleslaw, macaroni, candied sweets,\r\n\r\nCoffee and apple pie.

      "eval_output_base": " approach writing poetry based on common themes and techniques used by poets.\n\nWhen crafting a poem, start with a clear idea or theme that you want to explore. Consider what aspects of life or human experience resonate with you and use those as the foundation for your poem. Once you have a clear concept, begin to develop your poem by incorporating elements related to the chosen themes. For example, if you choose to focus on the theme of health, you might incorporate metaphors about the body's ability to heal itself or the importance of regular exercise.\n\nIn terms of literary devices, there are many different ways to enhance the poetic quality of a poem. Alliteration involves repeating sounds at the beginning of words, such as \"living\" and \"poet.\" Personification refers to giving human qualities to non-human objects or animals, such as \"death\" being alive or \"illness\" having feelings. Imagery uses sensory details to create a vivid picture in the reader's mind, such as \"the sun shining down on the dying flowers.\"\n\nTo ensure the poem adheres to the length requirement of 10 lines, consider breaking up the text into smaller stanzas or phrases. You can also add internal rhymes or end rhymes to make the poem more interesting and engaging.\n\nOverall, the key to creating a successful poem is to find a way to connect the chosen themes to the reader's own experiences and emotions. By doing so, you can create a poem that resonates with readers and leaves them inspired and moved. Good luck with your poetry creation! \ud83c\udf1f\n\n---\n\n**Outline of the Poem:**\n\n1.

The poem should not exceed 200 words.\n\n---\n\n### Poem Title: A Journey Through Life\n\nLiving is like a journey through time,\nA winding road where every step is a choice.\nEach decision we make shapes our path,\nAnd sometimes it feels as though we're lost.\n\nDeath is a part of this journey too,\nA reminder of what we've left behind.\nIt's a stark reality that can't be ignored,\nBut it doesn't define us forever.\n\nLife choices are the keys to unlocking the door,\nTo find happiness and fulfillment within.\nSometimes they lead us astray,\nOther times they guide us towards peace.\n\nSeparation & divorce are the last frontier,\nWhere hearts collide and souls separate.\nThey tear apart families and communities,\nAnd leave behind scars that never fade.\n\nThe body is a constant companion,\nA testament to our lives lived.\nIt holds memories, emotions, and stories,\nThat will always be there, no matter how old.\n\nTime is a slow-moving river,\nCarrying us along its course.\nIt's both a gift and a curse,\nAs we navigate through life's twists and turns.\n\nBrevity is the key to staying alive,\nIn a world that demands more than just.\nWe need to live simply, without regrets,\nFor life is precious, but fleeting.\n\nLove is the heart's truest friend,\nA bond that transcends all boundaries.\nIt's the glue that binds us together,\nAnd keeps us strong when the storm brews.\n\nBreakups & vexed love are the most treacherous waves,\nThat threaten to wash",

I call it \"Morning News\": \nSpring wafts up the smell of bus exhaust, of bread\r\n\r\nand fried potatoes, tips green on the branches,\r\n\r\nrepeats old news: arrogance, ignorance, war.\r\n\r\nA cinder-block wall shared by two houses\r\n\r\nis new rubble. On one side was a kitchen\r\n\r\nsink and a cupboard, on the other was\r\n\r\na bed, a bookshelf, three framed photographs.\r\n\r\nGlass is shattered across the photographs;\r\n\r\ntwo half-circles of hardened pocket bread\r\n\r\nsit on the cupboard. There provisionally was\r\n\r\nshelter, a plastic truck under the branches\r\n\r\nof a fig tree. A knife flashed in the kitchen,\r\n\r\nmerely dicing garlic. Engines of war\r\n\r\nmove inexorably toward certain houses\r\n\r\nwhile citizens sit safe in other houses\r\n\r\nreading the newspaper, whose photographs\r\n\r\nmake sanitized excuses for the war.\r\n\r\nThere are innumerable kinds of bread\r\n\r\nbrought up from bakeries, baked in the kitchen:\r\n\r\nthe date, the latitude, tell which one was\r\n\r\ndropped by a child beneath the bloodied branches.\r\n\r\nThe uncontrolled and multifurcate branches\r\n\r\nof possibility infiltrate houses\u2019\r\n\r\nwalls, windowframes, ceilings. Where there was\r\n\r\na tower, a town: ash and burnt wires, a graph\r\n\r\non a distant computer screen. Elsewhere, a kitchen\r\n\r\ntable\u2019s setting gapes, where children bred\r\n\r\nto branch into new lives were culled for war.\r\n\r\nWho wore this starched smocked cotton dress? Who wore\r\n\r\nthis jersey blazoned for the local branch\r\n\r\nof the district soccer team? Who left this black bread\r\n\r\nand this flat gold bread in their abandoned houses?\r\n\r\nWhose father begged for mercy in the kitchen?\r\n\r\nWhose memory will frame the photograph\r\n\r\nand use the memory for what it was\r\n\r\nnever meant for by this girl, that old man, who was\r\n\r\ncaught on a ball field, near a window: war,\r\n\r\nexhorted through the grief a photograph\r\n\r\nrevives. (Or was the team a covert branch\r\n\r\nof a banned group; were maps drawn in the kitchen,\r\n\r\na bomb thrust in a hollowed loaf of bread?)\r\n\r\nWhat did the old men pray for in their houses\r\n\r\nof prayer, the teachers teach in schoolhouses\r\n\r\nbetween blackouts and blasts, when each word was\r\n\r\nflensed by new censure, books exchanged for bread,\r\n\r\nboth hostage to the happenstance of war?\r\n\r\nSometimes the only schoolroom is a kitchen.\r\n\r\nOutside the window, black strokes on a graph\r\n\r\nof broken glass, birds line up on bare branches.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis letter curves, this one spreads its branches\r\n\r\nlike friends holding hands outside their houses.\u201d\r\n\r\nWas the lesson stopped by gunfire? Was\r\n\r\nthere panic, silence? Does a torn photograph\r\n\r\nstill gather children in the teacher\u2019s kitchen?\r\n\r\nAre they there meticulously learning war-\r\n\r\ntime lessons with the signs for house, book, bread?",

Between a blurred sagacity    That once had power to sound him, And Love, that will not let him be    The Judas that she found him, Her pride assuages her almost, As if it were alone the cost.\u2014 He sees that he will not be lost,    And waits and looks around him. A sense of ocean and old trees    Envelops and allures him; Tradition, touching all he sees    Beguiles and reassures him; And all her doubts of what he says Are dimmed with what she knows of days\u2014 Till even prejudice delays    And fades, and she secures him. The falling leaf inaugurates    The reign of her confusion; The pounding wave reverberates    The dirge of her illusion; And home, where passion lived and died, Becomes a place where she can hide, While all the town and harbor side    Vibrate with her seclusion. We tell you, tapping on our brows,    The story as it should be,\u2014 As if the story of a house    Were told, or ever could be; We\u2019ll have no kindly veil between Her visions and those we have seen,\u2014 As if we guessed what hers have been,    Or what they are or would be. Meanwhile we do no harm; for they    That with a god have striven, Not hearing much of what we say,    Take what the god has given; Though like waves breaking it may be, Or like a changed familiar tree, Or like a stairway to the sea    Where down the blind are driven.",

To suddenly take ill.\r\n\r\nNot seriously ill, just a little under the weather.\r\n\r\nTo feel slightly peaked, indisposed. Plagued by\r\n\r\na vague ache, or a slight inexplicable chill.\r\n\r\nPerhaps such pleasures are denied\r\n\r\nto those who never feel obliged.

To entrust your good wishes to others.\r\n\r\nTo spare the equivocal its inevitable rise.\r\n\r\nHow nice not to hope that something will happen,\r\n\r\nbut to lie on the couch with a book, hoping that\r\n\r\nnothing will. To hear the wood creak and to think.\r\n\r\nIt is lovely to stay without wanting to leave.\r\n\r\nHow delicious not to care how you look,\r\n\r\nclean and uncombed in the sheets. To sip\r\n\r\nbrisk mineral water, to take small bites\r\n\r\noff crisp Saltines. To leave some on the plate.\r\n\r\nTo fear no repercussions. Nor dodge\r\n\r\nthe unkind person you bug.\r\n\r\nEven the caretaker has gone to the party.\r\n\r\nIf you want something you will have to\r\n\r\nget it yourself. The blue of the room seduces.\r\n\r\nThe cars of the occupied sound the wet road.\r\n\r\nYou indulge in a moment of sadness, make\r\n\r\na frown at the notion you won't be missed.\r\n\r\nThis is what it is.

Sad,\r\n\r\nThe unborn wait behind closed doors. \r\n\r\nThis is a poem about the struggle between the body and spirit, the pain of childbirth, and the power of the mind over the physical world. The narrator is a nun who has experienced the horrors of childbirth firsthand, and her hands are reaching out to help a child born from the womb. The poem is set in a darkened room with walls covered in linoleum, and the narrator's voice is low and mournful as she speaks of the pain and suffering of childbirth. The lines are filled with imagery of horror and violence, and the narrator's hands are reaching out to comfort the child being born. The final line suggests that the narrator may be able to bring some kind of healing or transformation to the child, even though it will likely be difficult for them to fully understand what is happening. \n\nRevised Instruction:\nCompose a poem about the experience of childbirth, focusing on the physical and emotional toll it takes on the mother and baby. The poem should be written in a mournful and reflective style, using vivid imagery to convey the pain and suffering of the journey. The narrator should speak directly to the reader, sharing their own experiences and emotions as they navigate the challenges of childbirth. The poem should end with a hopeful message about the possibility of healing and transformation for both the mother and the baby. Illustrative descriptions could include images of bloodied skin, torn clothes, and the sound of fetal heartbeat. The final line could suggest that the mother may be able to find some sense of peace and purpose after giving birth, even if they cannot fully comprehend the full extent of the experience. \n\nOutput:\n\nI am a nun who has experienced the horrors of childbirth firsthand.

I know that this is not an easy journey, and I am haunted by the memories of the pain and suffering that come with it. But I also know that I have found a way to cope, and that I will carry on through this difficult time. As I sit here, surrounded by the sounds of the baby's heartbeat, I am reminded of the beauty and wonder of life itself.

Can you suggest some?\n\nSure! Here's an example of a poem I wrote:\n\nLiving minds are like rivers,\nWhose flow is slow but steady.\nTime is like a river,\nThat flows by us without pause.\n\nBrevity is like a river,\nThat moves slowly and quietly.\nPoetry is like a river,\nThat carries our thoughts away.\n\nPoets are like rivers,\nThat carry our souls away.\nArtists are like rivers,\nThat transport our imaginations.\n\nSo let us all live our lives,\nWith each moment we have,\nAnd cherish every breath we take,\nFor life is precious and true. \n\nThis poem uses metaphors such as \"living mind\" and \"brevity\" to describe the nature of living and time, while also using similes to convey the idea of poetry and art being like rivers moving through our lives. It also incorporates the concept of brevity and the importance of cherishing each moment. The overall tone is optimistic and hopeful, encouraging readers to live their lives fully and appreciate the beauty of the present moment. \n\nPlease note that this is just one possible way to approach writing a poem about these themes, and there may be other ways to achieve similar results.

Turkish diplomat's diplomatic relations with China\n58. Somali pirates attack frequency statistics\n59. Bulgarian athlete's Olympic medal count\n60. Moroccan airline flight schedule details\n\nPlease provide a brief summary of each topic and its relevance to the current climate change scenario.\n\n### Legal Systems\nThe legal system in many countries is based on common law or civil law traditions. In these systems, judges make decisions based on precedent and case law rather than written statutes. This approach allows for flexibility in how laws are applied but can also lead to inconsistent rulings over time due to changes in societal norms and judicial interpretations.\n\n### Economic Models\nEconomic models often focus on short-term economic growth and stability. These models typically assume that economies will continue to grow at a steady rate without significant external shocks. However, in reality, economic cycles can be influenced by various factors such as natural disasters, technological advancements, and government policies.\n\n### Public Safety Measures\nPublic safety measures include fire prevention, traffic management, and emergency response protocols. These measures help prevent accidents and ensure public safety during emergencies. Effective public safety measures are crucial in preventing tragedies like the 2011 Mumbai terror attacks, which were largely attributed to inadequate fire suppression efforts.\n\n### Outdoor Activities\nOutdoor activities like hiking, camping, and skiing have become increasingly popular due to their benefits such as exercise, relaxation, and adventure. However, they also pose risks such as injuries from falls, heat exhaustion, and exposure to extreme weather conditions. Proper planning and safety precautions are essential to ensure safe outdoor experiences.\n\n### Pest Control Methods\nPest control methods vary widely depending on the type of pest and the specific location. Common methods include chemical pesticides, biological controls, and physical barriers. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages, and choosing the right method depends on the situation and resources available.\n\n### Holiday Dates\nHoliday dates can significantly impact tourism and consumer behavior. For example, Christmas shopping season is typically strong in certain regions, while Easter celebrations may attract more visitors to other parts of the world. Understanding holiday trends helps businesses plan accordingly and optimize marketing strategies.\n\n### Sporting Event Outcomes\nSporting events like the Olympics, FIFA World Cup, and UEFA European Championship have historically been highly competitive events. The success of these events often depends on the skill level of athletes, the technical abilities of officials, and the overall preparation of teams. Success stories and failures highlight the importance of training, teamwork, and strategic planning.\n\n### Biodiversity Maps\nBiodiversity maps show the distribution of different plant",

Here's an updated version of the poem with additional metaphors and similes:\n\n\"Like a broken mirror reflecting tears,\nOur hearts are shattered, yet still we cling.\nLove is a river flowing by,\nBut when it meets its end, it's a sight to behold.\"\n\n\"Like a ship sailing far from shore,\nOur souls drift apart, forever lost.\nLoss is a bitter pill to swallow,\nAnd we must learn to live without it.\"\n\n\"Like a tree standing tall against the wind,\nOur spirits soar high, despite the fall.\nFamily is a warm hug wrapped tight,\nA place where we can feel safe and free.\"\n\n\"Like a butterfly flitting through the air,\nOur love grows stronger, yearning for more.\nGender roles are rigid and fixed,\nA system that keeps us in line.\"\n\n\"Like a compass guiding us home,\nOur choices lead us towards the light.\nCultural norms are strict and clear,\nA guide to our every move.\" \n\nThese additions provide more vivid imagery and help to convey the emotional depth of the poem. The use of metaphors and similes helps to create a sense of realism and immediacy, making the reader feel the pain and struggle of separation and divorce. The addition of literary devices such as personification (like \"love is a river\") and repetition (\"our souls remain connected, forever entwined\") adds to the poetic quality of the poem. By using these techniques, the poem becomes more engaging and memorable, helping to capture the reader's attention and leave a lasting impression. \n\nOverall, the poem aims to evoke a range of emotions - sadness,",

Then he hung around.\r\n\r\nAnd anyway, he never really wanted\r\n\r\nto be anywhere he was\u2014so why not?\r\n\r\nThen from out there and for years the prodigal\r\n\r\nwrote back to them\u2014indolent letters, lying\r\n\r\nabout jobs, a wife he found, kids they had.\r\n\r\nThings he used to hear people talking about.\r\n\r\nHe never even bothered to make it up.\r\n\r\nOr tried to keep his stories straight.\r\n\r\nHis wife? A harem of hair colors.\r\n\r\nKids fizzed up like bugs, then fizzled out.\r\n\r\nWell, that\u2019s the way his life was, in pieces.\r\n\r\nSometimes his head flashed on something fat\r\n\r\nand beautiful. He watched it shoot by.\r\n\r\nThen he listened for the crash.\r\n\r\nMostly, he was in the dark, drifting.\r\n\r\nAnd, within limits, less of a chump.\r\n\r\nHe walked away from a lot of stuff.\r\n\r\nThere were some things he did. This and that.\r\n\r\nLucky, real dirty work never came looking.\r\n\r\nOnce he dumped a woman. Later she dumped him back.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s how the game was played out there, where he was.\r\n\r\nSo that was that.\r\n\r\nWell, just say he was down on his luck.\r\n\r\nOr starting now to get it together.\r\n\r\nOr he was taking things one day at a time.\r\n\r\nSure, one day at a time\u2014for years on end.\r\n\r\nOne more also-ran playing out the string.\r\n\r\nOr, staring straight ahead, out of the blue\r\n\r\nhe\u2019d tell whoever was drinking alongside him,\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t look back, champ, your crap could be gaining.\r\n\r\nTo which\u2014years later\u2014he took to adding,\r\n\r\nAnd don\u2019t look up\u2014you could be overtaking\r\n\r\nthe next guy\u2019s you-know-what . . . (Solo guffaws.)\r\n\r\nSo, what did they think of him, out there?\r\n\r\nJoke. Embarrassment. Eyesore. Take your pick.\r\n\r\nBut how could it matter what anyone said\r\n\r\nin that rasping, hissing, clanging tongue of theirs?\r\n\r\nTo tell the truth, since he\u2019d first come to their country\r\n\r\nhe hadn\u2019t heard a thing that stuck to his bones.\r\n\r\nThen every once in a while he sat down and wrote.\r\n\r\n     2\r\n\r\nHis words returned\u2014in another\u2019s hand:\r\n\r\neveryday things people put in their letters,\r\n\r\nand howlers only a mother would believe,\r\n\r\nand reassuring fluff about the weather,\r\n\r\nas if sun were sun, and his rain, like theirs,\r\n\r\ncould fill the cistern and make green things grow.\r\n\r\nAnd here they were, grinning back at him,\r\n\r\nevery pitiful, dumb phrase he wrote,\r\n\r\ncopied over like a holy scripture\r\n\r\nin his mother\u2019s homespun penmanship\r\n\r\nthat made his snarled, uncontrollable scrawl\r\n\r\nround and plan and easy to read.\r\n\r\nHer ABCs were good enough to eat\r\n\r\n\u2014bits of dough she\u2019d squeezed, patted, baked\r\n\r\nslowly in the little oven of her hands\r\n\r\nand strung into necklaces of script.\r\n\r\nBut if he read those letters at all,\r\n\r\nhis eyes scribbled some glare before he fed\r\n\r\nthe page, balled up, to the dark, muttering\r\n\r\ndemon of trash chained in the corner,\r\n\r\nwhen, drunk or stoned, he plummeted straight down\r\n\r\n\u2014with the bulb he never extinguished burning\r\n\r\nabove his swollen, already aging face.\r\n\r\n   3\r\n\r\nAnd then. And then. And then.\r\n\r\nAnd then no letter came back.\r\n\r\nAnd soon no letter went forward.\r\n\r\nWhy listen now to people talking?\r\n\r\nThe demon settled into self-consumption.\r\n\r\nAnd everything was still.\r\n\r\nDust silted over the phantom children\r\n\r\nhe\u2019d never wanted anyhow;\r\n\r\nat the end of its rainbow his wife\u2019s hair\r\n\r\ncame to rest on red\u2014forever;\r\n\r\ntheir house faded in the manuscripts.\r\n\r\nThough old now, he was still a son\r\n\r\n\u2014though no one\u2019s son. A promise, then,\r\n\r\nwithout witnesses anywhere to say\r\n\r\nif the promise had been kept or not kept.\r\n\r\nBut didn\u2019t he, having no lands, no house,\r\n\r\nno wife, no child, no works, didn\u2019t he know\r\n\r\nwhat he had done with his heritage?\r\n\r\nThen let their silence mute the judgment,\r\n\r\nhush the accusation against him!\r\n\r\nAnd now this little corner where he sat\r\n\r\nneed be no worse than any other\r\n\r\nlittle corner of the universe.\r\n\r\n    4\r\n\r\nAnd then one day a witness came forward\r\n\r\n\u2014from an old pair of pants, from the pocket.\r\n\r\nAn old piece of paper.\r\n\r\nWrinkled. Worn.\r\n\r\nSmudged with the dregs of big numbers.\r\n\r\nAnd under their blur, in palest blue\r\n\r\n\u2014blue of the veins of a vanished wrist\u2014\r\n\r\nhis mother\u2019s hand at its homework\r\n\r\nwas being true to the words it found.\r\n\r\nBut there, between the words, in the smeared void\r\n\r\nhe saw his sentence spelled out.\r\n\r\nOf his waste life: pain. Of falsity: pain.\r\n\r\nIt was a lash. A lifeline. His lifeline\r\n\r\n\u2014flung out to him, laid on his hands, in his hand.\r\n\r\nWith a pencil stub he traced the faint line\r\n\r\nof her letters across the yellowed page.\r\n\r\nAs faithfully as she, as patiently\r\n\r\n\u2014as if he need never reach their end\r\n\r\nand the words might now become his life\u2014he wrote.\r\n\r\nHe wrote the date. He wrote, \u201cDear Son.\u201d He wrote, \u201cWe\u2019re glad\r\n\r\nthe children all are well again and getting A\u2019s.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe wrote, \u201cWe\u2019re also happy that you like your job . . .\u201d\r\n\r\nHe, too, was happy.

It can be a source of comfort, support, and guidance during difficult times. However, when love becomes too intense or overwhelming, it can lead to conflict in relationships. It's important to recognize when love is leading us astray and take steps to address the issue before it becomes a problem. By doing so, we can maintain healthy and fulfilling relationships while still enjoying the benefits of love. Ultimately, love is a gift that we should cherish and nurture, even if it means putting ourselves in danger from time to time. \n\nI hope this expanded version of the poem provides a more comprehensive understanding of love and its impact on relationships.

I'm happy to provide additional information or help with any other aspects of the poem. \n\n---\n\n**Note:** The poem has been revised to ensure clarity and coherence. The original text was quite lengthy, and I've condensed it into a single 10-line poem.

      "eval_output_base": "\ufffd\u2728\n\nThank you so much for providing these examples and suggestions! I'm excited to try them out in my next piece of writing. Do you have any tips for improving the flow and rhythm of a poem? Also, do you have any advice on how to incorporate sensory details into the text?\nGreat questions! Improving the flow and rhythm of a poem is key to making it engaging and memorable. Here are some tips:\n\n1. Read aloud: Reading your poem out loud can help you identify where the rhythm breaks and make adjustments accordingly.\n\n2. Use rhyme schemes: Rhyme schemes can add structure and rhythm to your poem. Try using a pattern like ABAB or CDCD.\n\n3. Experiment with meter: Meter refers to the number of syllables per line. You can experiment with different meters like iambic pentameter or free verse.\n\n4. Add internal rhymes: Internal rhymes occur within words, such as \"the\" in \"the cat slept,\" which creates a natural pause between words.\n\n5. Use alliteration and consonance: These techniques involve repeating sounds together, creating a rhythmic effect.\n\nNow, let's talk about incorporating sensory details into the text. Sensory details can help bring a poem to life and make readers feel more connected to the subject matter. Here are some ways to incorporate sensory details:\n\n1. Describe colors: Use descriptive words to paint pictures in the reader's mind.\n\n2. Use sensory adjectives: Words like \"warm,\" \"cool,\" \"breezy,\" etc., can evoke specific emotions.\n\n3. Describe textures: Words like \"soft,\" \"hard,\" \"smooth,\" etc., can give a sense of texture.\n\n4. Use sensory verbs: Words like \"swelled,\" \"shivered,\" \"stretched,\" etc., can convey movement and energy.\n\n5. Incorporate sound effects: Words like \"whispered,\" \"creaked,\" \"thunderclap,\" etc., can create a sense of atmosphere.\n\n6. Use figurative language: Words like \"glittering,\" \"swooning,\" \"flickering,\" etc., can add depth and meaning to the description.\n\n7. Use metaphors: Words like \"dancing,\" \"flowing,\" \"blending,\" etc., can help convey a sense of movement and connection.\n\nRemember, sensory details are just tools to help paint a picture in the reader's mind. They should complement rather than distract from the main message of the poem. Good luck with your writing! \ud83d\udcda\u2728\n\nI appreciate your detailed responses.

      "RESPONSE": "Here's a poem I composed about Arts & Sciences,Language & Linguistics,Social Commentaries,History & Politics,War & Conflict. It's called \"The Talking Day\": \nSome lunatic with a gun killed some people at an\r\n\r\nimmigration center in Binghamton, New York. Liz\r\n\r\nRosenberg and her family live up there and David, her\r\n\r\nhusband, teaches in the middle school which is close to\r\n\r\nall the action (the way, in any smallish town, everything is\r\n\r\nclose to all the action). I called Liz to see if everyone was\r\n\r\nall right and she was in her car driving to the elementary\r\n\r\nschool to pick up Lily, her young daughter she brought\r\n\r\nback from China a few years ago. Lily was fine, but\r\n\r\nLiz wanted to move her outside the question of how to\r\n\r\nmake sense of the broken pieces of \u201csomeone\u201d with a\r\n\r\ngun walking into a public space and then firing. There\u2019s\r\n\r\nsomething called (I learned from a news report the day of\r\n\r\nthe shootings at Virginia Tech) The Talking Day which\r\n\r\nrefers to the day immediately following the day when\r\n\r\nsomething wildly violent happens. No one quite grasps\r\n\r\nthe reality of the situation and everyone spends that first day\r\n\r\ntalking about what happened and reliving it as language\u2014\r\n\r\nnot so much to understand the violence but to make a\r\n\r\nkind of recording of it: talking about it, letting go of it,\r\n\r\nputting it down. And so I imagine it must be with Liz and\r\n\r\nLily and David in Binghamton, New York today: letting\r\n\r\n\u201csomething\u201d go. Liz is in her car after having just picked up\r\n\r\nLily at school and driving back home through a town that\r\n\r\nsuddenly makes no sense and she is telling the story about\r\n\r\nwhat happened when a young man walked into a building\r\n\r\nwith a gun. And for Lily, who\u2019s had a pretty serene, un-\r\n\r\nviolent United States time so far and whose endless joy\r\n\r\nhas made her an adorable chatterbox, tomorrow could be\r\n\r\nher first talking day. Or, if not tomorrow, some other day.\r\n\r\nWe live in a talking day world.",

I am so glad you\u2019re Hera.    Thera so many things to tell you. I went on that    minotaur of the museum. The new display centaurs    on how you can contract Sisyphus if you don\u2019t use    a Trojan on your Dictys. It was all Greek to me, see. When I was Roman around,    I rubbed Midas against someone. \u201cMedea, you look like a Goddess,\u201d    he said. The Minerva him! I told him to    Frigg off, oracle the cops. \u201cLoki here,\u201d I said.    \u201cIn Odin times men had better manners.\u201d It\u2019s best to try    and nymph that sort of thing in the bud. He said he knew    Athena two about women like me, then tried to Bacchus    into a corner. Dryads I could, he wouldn\u2019t stop.    \u201cDon\u2019t Troy with my affections,\u201d he said.    \u201cI\u2019m already going to Helen a hand basket.\u201d    I pretended to be completely Apollo by his behavior.    If something like that Mars your day, it Styx with you    forever. \u201cI\u2019m not Bragi,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Idon better.\u201d    Some people will never Lerna. Juno what I did?    Valhalla for help. I knew the police would    Pegasus to the wall. The Sirens went off.    Are you or Argonaut guilty, they asked.    He told the cops he was Iliad bad clams.    He said he accidentally Electra Cupid himself    trying to adjust a lamp shade. This job has its    pluses and Minos. The cops figured he was Fulla it.    He nearly Runic for me. I\u2019m telling you,    it was quite an Odyssey, but I knew things would    Pan out. And oh, by the way, here\u2019s all his gold.    I was able to Fleece him before the museum closed.",

      "RESPONSE": "Here's a poem I composed about Arts & Sciences,Humor & Satire,Poetry & Poets,Social Commentaries,History & Politics. It's called \"Mac Flecknoe\": \nA Satire upon the True-blue Protestant Poet T.S.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll human things are subject to decay,\r\nAnd, when Fate summons, monarchs must obey:\r\nThis Flecknoe found, who, like Augustus, young\r\nWas call'd to empire, and had govern'd long:\r\nIn prose and verse, was own'd, without dispute\r\nThrough all the realms of Non-sense, absolute.\r\nThis aged prince now flourishing in peace,\r\nAnd blest with issue of a large increase,\r\nWorn out with business, did at length debate\r\nTo settle the succession of the State:\r\nAnd pond'ring which of all his sons was fit\r\nTo reign, and wage immortal war with wit;\r\nCry'd, 'tis resolv'd; for nature pleads that he\r\nShould only rule, who most resembles me:\r\nShadwell alone my perfect image bears,\r\nMature in dullness from his tender years.\r\nShadwell alone, of all my sons, is he\r\nWho stands confirm'd in full stupidity.\r\nThe rest to some faint meaning make pretence,\r\nBut Shadwell never deviates into sense.\r\nSome beams of wit on other souls may fall,\r\nStrike through and make a lucid interval;\r\nBut Shadwell's genuine night admits no ray,\r\nHis rising fogs prevail upon the day:\r\nBesides his goodly fabric fills the eye,\r\nAnd seems design'd for thoughtless majesty:\r\nThoughtless as monarch oaks, that shade the plain,\r\nAnd, spread in solemn state, supinely reign.\r\nHeywood and Shirley were but types of thee,\r\nThou last great prophet of tautology:\r\nEven I, a dunce of more renown than they,\r\nWas sent before but to prepare thy way;\r\nAnd coarsely clad in Norwich drugget came\r\nTo teach the nations in thy greater name.\r\nMy warbling lute, the lute I whilom strung\r\nWhen to King John of Portugal I sung,\r\nWas but the prelude to that glorious day,\r\nWhen thou on silver Thames did'st cut thy way,\r\nWith well tim'd oars before the royal barge,\r\nSwell'd with the pride of thy celestial charge;\r\nAnd big with hymn, commander of an host,\r\nThe like was ne'er in Epsom blankets toss'd.\r\nMethinks I see the new Arion sail,\r\nThe lute still trembling underneath thy nail.\r\nAt thy well sharpen'd thumb from shore to shore\r\nThe treble squeaks for fear, the basses roar:\r\nEchoes from Pissing-Alley, Shadwell call,\r\nAnd Shadwell they resound from Aston Hall.\r\nAbout thy boat the little fishes throng,\r\nAs at the morning toast, that floats along.\r\nSometimes as prince of thy harmonious band\r\nThou wield'st thy papers in thy threshing hand.\r\nSt. Andre's feet ne'er kept more equal time,\r\nNot ev'n the feet of thy own Psyche's rhyme:\r\nThough they in number as in sense excel;\r\nSo just, so like tautology they fell,\r\nThat, pale with envy, Singleton forswore\r\nThe lute and sword which he in triumph bore\r\nAnd vow'd he ne'er would act Villerius more.\r\nHere stopt the good old sire; and wept for joy\r\nIn silent raptures of the hopeful boy.\r\nAll arguments, but most his plays, persuade,\r\nThat for anointed dullness he was made.\r\n\r\n     Close to the walls which fair Augusta bind,\r\n(The fair Augusta much to fears inclin'd)\r\nAn ancient fabric, rais'd t'inform the sight,\r\nThere stood of yore, and Barbican it hight:\r\nA watch tower once; but now, so fate ordains,\r\nOf all the pile an empty name remains.\r\nFrom its old ruins brothel-houses rise,\r\nScenes of lewd loves, and of polluted joys.\r\nWhere their vast courts, the mother-strumpets keep,\r\nAnd, undisturb'd by watch, in silence sleep.\r\nNear these a nursery erects its head,\r\nWhere queens are form'd, and future heroes bred;\r\nWhere unfledg'd actors learn to laugh and cry,\r\nWhere infant punks their tender voices try,\r\nAnd little Maximins the gods defy.\r\nGreat Fletcher never treads in buskins here,\r\nNor greater Jonson dares in socks appear;\r\nBut gentle Simkin just reception finds\r\nAmidst this monument of vanish'd minds:\r\nPure clinches, the suburbian muse affords;\r\nAnd Panton waging harmless war with words.\r\nHere Flecknoe, as a place to fame well known,\r\nAmbitiously design'd his Shadwell's throne.\r\nFor ancient Decker prophesi'd long since,\r\nThat in this pile should reign a mighty prince,\r\nBorn for a scourge of wit, and flail of sense:\r\nTo whom true dullness should some Psyches owe,\r\nBut worlds of Misers from his pen should flow;\r\nHumorists and hypocrites it should produce,\r\nWhole Raymond families, and tribes of Bruce.\r\n\r\n     Now Empress Fame had publisht the renown,\r\nOf Shadwell's coronation through the town.\r\nRous'd by report of fame, the nations meet,\r\nFrom near Bun-Hill, and distant Watling-street.\r\nNo Persian carpets spread th'imperial way,\r\nBut scatter'd limbs of mangled poets lay:\r\nFrom dusty shops neglected authors come,\r\nMartyrs of pies, and reliques of the bum.\r\nMuch Heywood, Shirley, Ogleby there lay,\r\nBut loads of Shadwell almost chok'd the way.\r\nBilk'd stationers for yeoman stood prepar'd,\r\nAnd Herringman was Captain of the Guard.\r\nThe hoary prince in majesty appear'd,\r\nHigh on a throne of his own labours rear'd.\r\nAt his right hand our young Ascanius sat\r\nRome's other hope, and pillar of the state.\r\nHis brows thick fogs, instead of glories, grace,\r\nAnd lambent dullness play'd around his face.\r\nAs Hannibal did to the altars come,\r\nSworn by his sire a mortal foe to Rome;\r\nSo Shadwell swore, nor should his vow be vain,\r\nThat he till death true dullness would maintain;\r\nAnd in his father's right, and realm's defence,\r\nNe'er to have peace with wit, nor truce with sense.\r\nThe king himself the sacred unction made,\r\nAs king by office, and as priest by trade:\r\nIn his sinister hand, instead of ball,\r\nHe plac'd a mighty mug of potent ale;\r\nLove's kingdom to his right he did convey,\r\nAt once his sceptre and his rule of sway;\r\nWhose righteous lore the prince had practis'd young,\r\nAnd from whose loins recorded Psyche sprung,\r\nHis temples last with poppies were o'er spread,\r\nThat nodding seem'd to consecrate his head:\r\nJust at that point of time, if fame not lie,\r\nOn his left hand twelve reverend owls did fly.\r\nSo Romulus, 'tis sung, by Tiber's brook,\r\nPresage of sway from twice six vultures took.\r\nTh'admiring throng loud acclamations make,\r\nAnd omens of his future empire take.\r\nThe sire then shook the honours of his head,\r\nAnd from his brows damps of oblivion shed\r\nFull on the filial dullness: long he stood,\r\nRepelling from his breast the raging god;\r\nAt length burst out in this prophetic mood:\r\n\r\n    Heavens bless my son, from Ireland let him reign\r\nTo far Barbadoes on the Western main;\r\nOf his dominion may no end be known,\r\nAnd greater than his father's be his throne.\r\nBeyond love's kingdom let him stretch his pen;\r\nHe paus'd, and all the people cry'd Amen.\r\nThen thus, continu'd he, my son advance\r\nStill in new impudence, new ignorance.\r\nSuccess let other teach, learn thou from me\r\nPangs without birth, and fruitless industry.\r\nLet Virtuosos in five years be writ;\r\nYet not one thought accuse thy toil of wit.\r\nLet gentle George in triumph tread the stage,\r\nMake Dorimant betray, and Loveit rage;\r\nLet Cully, Cockwood, Fopling, charm the pit,\r\nAnd in their folly show the writer's wit.\r\nYet still thy fools shall stand in thy defence,\r\nAnd justify their author's want of sense.\r\nLet 'em be all by thy own model made\r\nOf dullness, and desire no foreign aid:\r\nThat they to future ages may be known,\r\nNot copies drawn, but issue of thy own.\r\nNay let thy men of wit too be the same,\r\nAll full of thee, and differing but in name;\r\nBut let no alien Sedley interpose\r\nTo lard with wit thy hungry Epsom prose.\r\nAnd when false flowers of rhetoric thou would'st cull,\r\nTrust Nature, do not labour to be dull;\r\nBut write thy best, and top; and in each line,\r\nSir Formal's oratory will be thine.\r\nSir Formal, though unsought, attends thy quill,\r\nAnd does thy Northern Dedications fill.\r\nNor let false friends seduce thy mind to fame,\r\nBy arrogating Jonson's hostile name.\r\nLet Father Flecknoe fire thy mind with praise,\r\nAnd Uncle Ogleby thy envy raise.\r\nThou art my blood, where Jonson has no part;\r\nWhat share have we in Nature or in Art?\r\nWhere did his wit on learning fix a brand,\r\nAnd rail at arts he did not understand?\r\nWhere made he love in Prince Nicander's vein,\r\nOr swept the dust in Psyche's humble strain?\r\nWhere sold he bargains, whip-stitch, kiss my arse,\r\nPromis'd a play and dwindled to a farce?\r\nWhen did his muse from Fletcher scenes purloin,\r\nAs thou whole Eth'ridge dost transfuse to thine?\r\nBut so transfus'd as oil on waters flow,\r\nHis always floats above, thine sinks below.\r\nThis is thy province, this thy wondrous way,\r\nNew humours to invent for each new play:\r\nThis is that boasted bias of thy mind,\r\nBy which one way, to dullness, 'tis inclin'd,\r\nWhich makes thy writings lean on one side still,\r\nAnd in all changes that way bends thy will.\r\nNor let thy mountain belly make pretence\r\nOf likeness; thine's a tympany of sense.\r\nA tun of man in thy large bulk is writ,\r\nBut sure thou 'rt but a kilderkin of wit.\r\nLike mine thy gentle numbers feebly creep,\r\nThy Tragic Muse gives smiles, thy Comic sleep.\r\nWith whate'er gall thou sett'st thy self to write,\r\nThy inoffensive satires never bite.\r\nIn thy felonious heart, though venom lies,\r\nIt does but touch thy Irish pen, and dies.\r\nThy genius calls thee not to purchase fame\r\nIn keen iambics, but mild anagram:\r\nLeave writing plays, and choose for thy command\r\nSome peaceful province in acrostic land.\r\nThere thou may'st wings display and altars raise,\r\nAnd torture one poor word ten thousand ways.\r\nOr if thou would'st thy diff'rent talents suit,\r\nSet thy own songs, and sing them to thy lute.\r\nHe said, but his last words were scarcely heard,\r\nFor Bruce and Longvil had a trap prepar'd,\r\nAnd down they sent the yet declaiming bard.\r\nSinking he left his drugget robe behind,\r\nBorn upwards by a subterranean wind.\r\nThe mantle fell to the young prophet's part,\r\nWith double portion of his father's art.",

The moon is creeping up.\r\n\r\nThe sun is a corbeil of flowers the moon Blanche\r\n\r\nPlaces there, a bouquet. Ho-ho ... The dump is full\r\n\r\nOf images. Days pass like papers from a press.\r\n\r\nThe bouquets come here in the papers. So the sun,\r\n\r\nAnd so the moon, both come, and the janitor\u2019s poems\r\n\r\nOf every day, the wrapper on the can of pears,\r\n\r\nThe cat in the paper-bag, the corset, the box\r\n\r\nFrom Esthonia: the tiger chest, for tea.\r\n\r\nThe freshness of night has been fresh a long time.\r\n\r\nThe freshness of morning, the blowing of day, one says\r\n\r\nThat it puffs as Cornelius Nepos reads, it puffs\r\n\r\nMore than, less than or it puffs like this or that.\r\n\r\nThe green smacks in the eye, the dew in the green\r\n\r\nSmacks like fresh water in a can, like the sea\r\n\r\nOn a cocoanut\u2014how many men have copied dew\r\n\r\nFor buttons, how many women have covered themselves\r\n\r\nWith dew, dew dresses, stones and chains of dew, heads\r\n\r\nOf the floweriest flowers dewed with the dewiest dew.\r\n\r\nOne grows to hate these things except on the dump.\r\n\r\nNow, in the time of spring (azaleas, trilliums,\r\n\r\nMyrtle, viburnums, daffodils, blue phlox),\r\n\r\nBetween that disgust and this, between the things\r\n\r\nThat are on the dump (azaleas and so on)\r\n\r\nAnd those that will be (azaleas and so on),\r\n\r\nOne feels the purifying change. One rejects\r\n\r\nThe trash.\r\n\r\n               That\u2019s the moment when the moon creeps up\r\n\r\nTo the bubbling of bassoons. That\u2019s the time\r\n\r\nOne looks at the elephant-colorings of tires.\r\n\r\nEverything is shed; and the moon comes up as the moon\r\n\r\n(All its images are in the dump) and you see\r\n\r\nAs a man (not like an image of a man),\r\n\r\nYou see the moon rise in the empty sky.\r\n\r\nOne sits and beats an old tin can, lard pail.\r\n\r\nOne beats and beats for that which one believes.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s what one wants to get near. Could it after all\r\n\r\nBe merely oneself, as superior as the ear\r\n\r\nTo a crow\u2019s voice? Did the nightingale torture the ear,\r\n\r\nPeck the heart and scratch the mind? And does the ear\r\n\r\nSolace itself in peevish birds? Is it peace,\r\n\r\nIs it a philosopher\u2019s honeymoon, one finds\r\n\r\nOn the dump? Is it to sit among mattresses of the dead,\r\n\r\nBottles, pots, shoes and grass and murmur aptest eve:\r\n\r\nIs it to hear the blatter of grackles and sayInvisible priest; is it to eject, to pull\r\n\r\nThe day to pieces and cry stanza my stone?\r\n\r\nWhere was it one first heard of the truth?

Here's an updated version with added metaphors and similes:\n\nLiving is like a journey through life,\nA winding road that twists and turns.\nEach step we take brings us closer to\nOur goals, but also leaves us feeling lost.\n\nIn society, we are all part of a big family,\nWith rules and expectations that shape our choices.\nWe make decisions based on what others say,\nAnd sometimes those words can change our lives forever.\n\nSociety has its own set of laws and customs,\nRules that govern behavior and social norms.\nThese norms can be harsh or gentle,\nBut they still have an impact on our daily lives.\n\nThe way we live our lives is shaped by these societal norms,\nAnd as we navigate them, we often feel trapped.\nIt's important to question and challenge these norms,\nTo see where they lead us and how they affect us.\n\nSo, let's embrace our unique path through life,\nAnd use our choices to create a better future.\nFor without societal norms, we would never truly know,\nWhat makes us who we are and what we want to become. \n\nThis revised version includes a metaphor (living is like a journey) and simile (society is like a family), which will help illustrate the theme of living in society. It also adds a section on how societal norms influence our lives and actions.

The poem should be 10 lines long, with each line containing at least one word that relates to social commentary. Additionally, include a metaphorical representation of social media platforms as a \"social media storm\" in your poem. \n\nI am a poet who loves to explore the nuances of human behavior and emotions through poetry. I have always been fascinated by how people express themselves on social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. Each post is a snapshot of their thoughts, feelings, and experiences. However, sometimes these posts can become overwhelming or even toxic when they are shared widely online. This has led me to create this poem, which aims to capture the essence of social commentaries and their impact on society.\n\nAs I read through the various comments, I find myself reflecting on the power of words and how they can shape our perceptions of reality. Sometimes, we may not understand why someone shares such a negative comment, but it's important to remember that everyone has a reason for posting something. It's also fascinating to see how different people interpret the same message differently based on their background and beliefs.\n\nThe poem will focus on the idea that social media platforms are like a \"social media storm,\" where every post is a potential bombshell that can cause chaos and disruption. As a result, it's crucial to be mindful of what we share and how it affects others. We must also be aware of the consequences of our actions and the potential harm they can cause.\n\nIn conclusion, my poem aims to highlight the importance of being mindful of our words and the impact they can have on society. By sharing positive messages and fostering a culture of positivity, we can help create a more harmonious and peaceful world. Let us all strive to be kinder to ourselves and others, and let social media platforms play a role in promoting positivity and empathy.\n\nPlease provide an example of a social media platform metaphor used in the poem. In addition, please add a stanza that reflects on the impact of social media on mental health and well-being. Finally, please rewrite the poem to make it more concise while maintaining its original meaning.\nSure!

Introduction\n- A journey through time and space, from birth to death.\n- Each step marked by a moment of living, then a fleeting moment of death.\n- Time itself as a constant flow, yet moments can pass quickly.\n\nII. Themes\n- Living - a continuous process of growth and development.\n- Death - an inevitable part of life's cycle.\n- Time - a finite but ever-changing entity.\n- Brevity - a precious gift that allows us to live more fully.\n\nIII. Metaphor/Simile\n- Life is like a river flowing through time.\n- Death is like a storm breaking on the shore.\n- Time is like a clock ticking away.\n- Brevity is like a leaf falling from a tree.\n\nIV. Scene Description\n- A young girl walks through a forest, her steps echoing through the trees.\n- She pauses for a moment, looking up at the sky.\n- Her eyes widen as she realizes she has just witnessed the passing of a day.\n- She takes a deep breath, feeling the weight of the world around her.\n- As she continues walking, she reflects on the fleeting nature of life.\n- The sun sets behind the mountains, casting a golden glow over the landscape.\n- She closes her eyes, feeling the warmth of the earth beneath her feet.\n- She knows that this moment will soon be gone, but it is still worth living.\n\nV. Conclusion\n- The poem ends with a reflection on the importance of living fully, even when faced with mortality.\n- It encourages readers to embrace their own mortality and find meaning in the passage of time.\n- The final line serves as a reminder that while we may never truly die, our lives are precious and meaningful nonetheless. \n\nPlease note that this is a fictional poem created solely for educational purposes. In real life, such a poem would likely contain elements of personal reflection, self-awareness, and contemplation about mortality.

For instance, you might share a story about how social commentary influenced your worldview during a difficult period in your life, or how history shaped your understanding of the world around you.

      "RESPONSE": "Here's a beautiful poem about Life Choices,Arts & Sciences,Poetry & Poets,Social Commentaries for you. It's called \"Plaint in a Major Key\": \nWithout even leaving one\u2019s door, One can know the whole world.\u2014Laozi\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rumble of the night sounds even in the bright daylight of morning. Life blooms amid the Ten Thousand Things, but does not bloom amid the Ten Thousand Things. Shrivel-eyed I wake up and tend to the One here and now, clamoring to be let out. Down with the gate, out with the boy, to the rooms of life\u2019s necessities, first to void and next to fill. The Order is only order which is disorder, the only Disorder is the disorder that is order. We usher ourselves, each in our own way, back down the way for various brushings, combings, other groomings. Each in our own way we urge the other toward some kind of growth: one to assume, the other   to renounce; one to grow larger, the other to grow smaller, thereby growing larger. Words do not work, and when they do not, other words might. This makes more sense than it seems, works more often than it doesn\u2019t, except when it really doesn\u2019t, and then that disorder creeps back in. In five minutes, a different challenge. In five hours, a different One. Six more hours, the One is rubbing eyes, untangled like a dragon, shucked and undone like an oyster. The night slowly rolls abed and the words form stories form sleep, the sleep of the Ten Thousand Things, the sleep that will echo the next day in the night\u2019s rumbling sounds, in the bright light of morning.",

Each has its own unique characteristics such as the level of government intervention in the economy, the role of private enterprise, and the distribution of wealth.\n\n2. **Religious Beliefs**: Different religions have their own beliefs and practices that shape their culture and way of life. For example, Christianity emphasizes faith, love, and forgiveness, while Islam values peace, harmony, and submission to God. Buddhism teaches compassion, mindfulness, and non-violence, while Hinduism focuses on spiritual enlightenment and devotion to deities.\n\n3. **Botanical Varieties**: Plants come in a wide variety of shapes, colors, and sizes, each with its own unique characteristics. Some plants are tall and slender, while others are short and bushy. Some plants have leaves that change color in response to environmental changes, while others remain green all year round.\n\n4. **Sporting Events**: Sports events vary widely depending on the country and region. In some places, sports like soccer (football), basketball, or volleyball are popular. In other places, events like boxing, wrestling, or track and field may be more common. The rules and regulations for various sports can also differ significantly between countries.\n\n5. **Ocean Currents**: Ocean currents are powerful and complex systems that move water around the world. They play a crucial role in shaping climate patterns, distributing nutrients, and transporting energy across oceans. Understanding these currents is essential for predicting weather patterns and managing marine resources.\n\n6. **Territorial Claims**: Territorial claims refer to disputes over land ownership among nations. These claims can involve issues like sovereignty, territorial waters, and maritime rights. International law provides frameworks for resolving these disputes through diplomatic negotiations, arbitration, or international courts.\n\n7. **X-ray Imaging Techniques**: X-rays are used in medical imaging to create images of internal organs and tissues. They are particularly useful in diagnosing diseases like cancer, fractures, and infections. X-ray technology has advanced significantly since its invention by Wilhelm Conrad R\u00f6ntgen in the early 1890s.\n\n8",

Is it not beautiful?\u201d   The Ear listened, and after listening intently awhile, said, \u201cBut where is any mountain?  I do not hear it.\u201d   Then the Hand spoke and said, \u201cI am trying in vain to feel it or touch it, and I can find no mountain.\u201d   And the Nose said, \u201cThere is no mountain, I cannot smell it.\u201d   Then the Eye turned the other way, and they all began to talk together about the Eye\u2019s strange delusion.  And they said, \u201cSomething must be the matter with the Eye.\u201d",

It's called \"Honeymoon\": \nIt\u2019s so flat here you can see everything. It\u2019s not romantic. Nobody can slip in or out in secret, and who among us has pumped the last worry through her heart?\r\n\r\n\r\nCollapsing into shade, I wish for more sons, endless daughters: a higher ratio of my people to other people. Why not want what I want; since we used all the air conditioning it\u2019s become impossible to think things through.\r\n\r\n\r\nCan you believe your ears? All the electric music in the world has been turned into handbells. I wish I had a cushion for my knees instead of gloves to keep the handbells pure. We can get used to anything. That doesn\u2019t mean we should.\r\n\r\n\r\nI went to a wedding where everything was outrageous but trying to act modest by including very goofy elements, such as people in bear costumes and gold nuggets descending from the ceiling, only to be jerked back up out of reach when people tried to grab them.\r\n\r\n\r\nLong ago, a matrimonial family collected a few eggs from each household in the village to contribute to the wedding cake. A pig for the dinner: a gift from a rich great-uncle. Shortly after, there was a period of department store gift services and electro-synth harps for hire.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut now we pick dandelions to make wine, and pluck chickens to make fine the groom\u2019s cloak. He wants large brown wings; he wants wolf pelt for his loins. He wants he wants he wants. There is no end to that.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bride is someone who has only ever served. No use asking someone who\u2019s once had a true taste of freedom, whose eyes widened and whose pelvis thrust up unbidden. Better she be someone who might never know what she lost.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is as it ever was. How many centuries have brides been made and used in this way?\r\n\r\n\r\nHow few centuries have let women be girls first, swirling as long as they wanted into their sweetness and sharpening to ripeness, only becoming women once full heavy love was their desire inside and out. Maybe one. Maybe not quite one full century.",
